          <h1>Why Should My Business Accept Bitcoin?</h1>
          <ul>
            <li>No "payment service" fees</li>
            <li>Immediate settlement. Accept and receive payment 24h a day, 7 days week, 365days a year. There's no such thing as a "business day"!</li>
            <li>Recieve payments using a basic smartphone.</li>
            <li>No required additional services to sign-up for</li>
            <li>Near zero transaction fees</li>
            <li>No need for customers to use a PIN or credit card number</li>
            <li>No third parties such as a bank, payment service provider, e-commerce or merchant provider are required</li>
            <li>No merchant account required. No account required at all</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>What is Bitcoin?</h4>
          <p>For a business-owner it operates simply as "electronic cash" with instant or near-instant settlement, no possibility of chargeback and the ability to send absolutely anywhere in the world.</p>

          <h4>Isn't Bitcoin Illegal?</h4>
          <p>Absolutely not. In fact the NZ government and IRD already permit businesses to pay their staff in Bitcoin.</p>

          <h4>Do I have to pay tax on Bitcoin income?</h4>
          <p>Yes, If you recieve Bitcoin as business income then you will have to pay GST and income tax just the same as if you were receiving dollars <a href="https://www.ird.govt.nz/cryptoassets" target="_new">IRD Cryptoassets guidance</a></p>

          <h4>Aren't there many "cryptocurrencies"?</h4>
          <p>There are a lot several off-shoot digital cash systems, some use the word "Bitcoin" in their names.</p>
          <p>Bitcoin itself is the original peer-to-peer digital cash system invented in 2008. It is the safest, most used, most decentralised, hard money we've ever had</p>

          <h4>What about all these hacks and exchanges going bust?</h4>
          <p>If youleave your Bitcoin on an exchange or leave it with any 3rd party your funds are at risk. If you self custody your own Bitcoin in your own Bitcoin wallet your funds are much safer.</p>

        <h1>How Bitcoin stacks up against the competition</h1>

          <p>The chart below shows the costs and benefits of receiving payments via the Bitcoin Lightning Network or the Boltcard.  For a low fee, Boltcard over the Lightning Network offers the conveniences of tap and pay.</p>

          <h1>What is bitcoin?</h1>

          <p>Bitcoin is a commodity money, a digital version of gold, launched in 2009. It is native to the internet and, like gold, does not require 3rd parties to transact. </p>
          <p>No banks, no governments, no owner and also no borders. Bitcoin is a global, decentralised and censorship resistant payments network.  It has a fixed supply which means the end of monetary inflation.</p>

          <p>When you receive Bitcoin you are receiving an asset, not someone else’s liability, aka debt. </p>
          <p><strong>RELIABLE Money</strong></p>
          <p class="lead">Bitcoin is a currency that gives you complete ownership.  Everyone can own and accumulate this asset.</p>

            <figcaption class="figure-caption">The fundamental properties of Bitcoin</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>Bitcoin can be sent anywhere in the world, quickly and cheaply. It has no need for a 3rd party like a bank or payments provider to be involved. A true financial revolution enabled by technology.</p>

          <h2>Volatility</h2>

          <p>In the short term, the value of Bitcoin can fluctuate a lot, but over time its price trends upwards. </p> 

          <p>Furthermore, the short term volatility of the Bitcoin price has been falling over time as more people are using it.</p>

          <h2>Bitcoin is scarce</h2>
          <p>Bitcoin’s code locks in a rule that there can only ever be 21 million Bitcoin.  Each Bitcoin is divisible into 100 million subunits called ‘Satoshis’.  This scarcity underpins Bitcoin’s value and makes it the first ultra hard money that is inherently globally transactable.</p>

          <p>NZ Dollars, on the other hand, can be created out of thin air by the central bank and retail banks and there is no upper limit on the amount in circulation. This allows governments and banks to extract value through inflation, to the cost of everyone else.</p>

          <p>The more pounds in circulation, the less purchasing power each pound has.  Printing money does not magically create more goods and services.</p>

          <h2>Why Lightning / Boltcard</h2>

          <p>The chart below this section shows the costs and benefits of receiving payments via the Bitcoin Lightning Network or the Boltcard.  For a low fee, Boltcard over the Lightning Network offers the conveniences of tap and pay.</p>

          <p class="lead">Bitcoin is a currency that gives you complete ownership.  Everyone can own and accumulate this asset.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin can be sent anywhere in the world, quickly and cheaply. It has no need for a 3rd party like a bank or payments provider to be involved. A true financial revolution enabled by technology.</p>

          <h2>What is bitcoin?</h2>

          <p>Bitcoin is a commodity money, a digital version of gold, launched in 2009. It is native to the internet and, like gold, does not require 3rd parties to transact. </p>
          <p>No banks, no governments, no owner and also no borders. Bitcoin is a global, decentralised and censorship resistant payments network.  It has a fixed supply which means the end of monetary inflation.</p>

          <p>When you receive Bitcoin you are receiving an asset, not someone else’s liability, aka debt. </p>

          <h2>Volatility</h2>

          <p>In the short term, the value of Bitcoin can fluctuate a lot, but over time its price trends upwards. </p> 

          <p>Furthermore, the short term volatility of the Bitcoin price has been falling over time as more people are using it.</p>

          <h2>Bitcoin is scarce</h2>
          <p>Bitcoin’s code locks in a rule that there can only ever be 21 million Bitcoin.  Each Bitcoin is divisible into 100 million subunits called ‘Satoshis’.  This scarcity underpins Bitcoin’s value and makes it the first ultra hard money that is inherently globally transactable.</p>

          <p>NZ Dollars, on the other hand, can be created out of thin air by the central bank and retail banks and there is no upper limit on the amount in circulation. This allows governments and banks to extract value through inflation, to the cost of everyone else.</p>

          <p>The more pounds in circulation, the less purchasing power each pound has.  Printing money does not magically create more goods and services.</p>
